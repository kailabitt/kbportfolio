                   <p>About me: I’m a designer and digital nerd most days and I have a strong interest in digital marketing trends, travel, illustrating and skiing. Three years ago, I moved back to Portland, after spending a yearlong engagement in Reykjavik, Iceland where I worked with the Icelandic Advertising Agency across their portfolio of projects in web development, strategy, video production, and branding. Since then, I’ve been working in Portland as a digital account manager at Grady Britton. I graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelors of Science degree, specializing in advertising and business with a concentration in design and digital strategy - What a mouthful! That all said, I like to think these skills boil down to one thing: producing a great product with excellence in digital/web project management. I took this course to expand my knowledge of web development more and inspire great digital work in the future.</p>

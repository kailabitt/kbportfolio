                   <p>About me: I’m a designer and digital nerd most days and I have a strong interest in digital marketing trends, travel, illustrating and skiing. Three years ago, I moved back to Portland, after spending a yearlong engagement in Reykjavik, Iceland where I worked with the Icelandic Advertising Agency across their portfolio of projects in web development, strategy, video production, and branding. Since then, I’ve worked myself up to a digital account executive role at DHX Advertising in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelors of Science degree, specializing in advertising and business with a concentration in design and digital strategy. What a mouthful! But I like to think all those skills just boil down to one thing: producing great brands with an excellence in digital project management.</p>
